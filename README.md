# Verilog Assignments – Digital Design

This repository contains Verilog code implementations and testbenches for 4 digital design assignments. Each assignment includes the necessary module and testbench files for simulation and verification.

## Assignment 1: 4:1 Multiplexer

- **Objective:** Design a 4:1 multiplexer using Verilog.

  - `4to1Mux.v` – Verilog code for 4:1 MUX.
  - `4to1Mux_tb.v` – Testbench for 4:1 MUX.

## Assignment 2: Full Adder

- **Objective:** Implement a full adder and its testbench.

  - `full_adder.v` – Verilog code for full adder.
  - `tb_full_adder.v` – Testbench with all possible input combinations.
  - `Waveform.png` – Screenshot of simulation result.

## Assignment 3:

### A) 2:1 Multiplexer

- **Objective:** Design a basic 2:1 multiplexer.
  
  - `mux2x1.v` – Verilog code for 2:1 MUX.
  - `tb_mux2x1.v` – Testbench for 2:1 MUX.

### B) MUX-DFF Feedback Loop

- **Objective:** Implement a feedback loop where MUX output feeds into a D flip-flop, and the DFF output is fed back into the MUX.
  
  - `mux_dff_loop.v` – Verilog code for the sequential circuit.
  - `tb_mux_dff_loop.v` – Testbench for simulation and verification.

## Assignment 4: Up and Down Counter

- **Objective:** Design a 4-bit up-down counter with control signal.
  
  - `up_down_counter.v` – Verilog code for the counter.
  - `tb_up_down_counter.v` – Testbench to test up/down behavior.
